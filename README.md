# Atma Bengali + Latin Fonts 

Atma is an original Bengali and Latin typeface family with a fun and informal feeling.
The Bengali and Latin were developed in parallel as a studio collaboration by Jeremie Hornus, Gregori Vincens, Yoann Minet, and Roxane Gataud. 

The Atma project is led by Black Foundry, a type design foundry based in Paris, France.
